	<h1>Paper Airplanes</h1>
	<p>All of these airplanes can be made without scissors, glue, or tape. All you need is one standard letter format sheet of paper.</p>
	<h3>The Classic Plane</h3>
	<p>This plane is the most basic flyable version of a paper plane. It has the least folding for the best resluts.</P>
	<h3>Trick Plane</h3>
	<p>It may not look like an airplane, but it does fly. With the correct configurations it can do loops, act as a boomerang, or do spirals during flight.</p>
	<h3>Super Plane</h3>
	<p>If you want something that can hold it's own outside, this plane is the one to fold.</p>
	<h3>Distance Plane</h3>
	<p>It doesn't do tricks, it just flies fast and far.</P>
